            <p>Within the Library, ten patron librarians will be at your disposal to recieve all of your guests. Each librarian is in charge of a different floor, and each floor
                has different abnormality pages that make them stand out from the other floors. As you progress through a given floor's abnormality battles, you'll uncover more of that
                librarian's story and growth as a character. Within each floor, four assistant librarians can be unlocked to further aid the patron
                librarian in combat, evening out the odds of each reception. Unlike the patron librarians, assistant librarians can have their apperance changed to the player's liking,
                allowing the player to create their own characters to play as in the game. More assistant librarians can be unlocked as more abnormality battles are completed on their respective
                floor. Below is a list of all the patron librarians, and their respective floor.

                    <p>Receptions are where the combat gameplay of Library of Ruina takes place. Before each reception, you must invite guests to the Library with books made from
                    your previous guests. After the guests are invited, you will begin the preperation phase of the battle. In the preperation phase, players can view the enemy guests'
                    combat pages, key pages, passives, and more information that can be used to select what floor would be best fit for recieving them. After the preperation phase, the
                    stageplay phase begins. In the stageplay phase, players will engage in turn-based combat using their decks to defeat theit current guests.
                    <a href="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/wiki/Reception" target="_blank">Click here for a detailed explanation of a reception and the battle mechanics.</a> Some battles have multiple acts
                    to be completed, and thus multiple preperation and stageplay phases.

                    <p>The Credenza is where all of the knowledge in the Library can be accessed by the player. Whether it be books or battle, chances are it can be found here.
                    The Credenza contains the books of defeated guests, and allows the player to read them to understand more about the City, different associations/syndicates, or about the person in general.
                    The Credenza also offers players a chance to rewatch the different cutscenes found throughout the game, but once they are unlocked.
                    If players want to replay an abnormality battle, or a floor realization, they can do so from the Credenza at will.
