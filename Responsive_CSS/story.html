            <h3 class="heading_style">Main Story</h3>
            <p>The main plot of the game follows Roland and Angela trying to each accomplish their own goals by creating "The One, Perfect Book". As players progress through the story, they come to learn more about the different
                associations, syndicates, and coorporations of the City work, as well as its harsh reality. The citizens know that they city can be dreadful to live in, but there's much more hidden in the shadows that make their only
                home miserable. As the library grows throughout the story, its threat level is upgraded to show just how much of an impact its making in the city. Every main story fight has episodes before and after the fight begins.
                The before episode provides background information on the guests, and the post-battle episode provides commentry between Roland and Angela.
                Players will fight their way up to the ranks from the unknown canard to an impuritas civitatis, where the most elite of fixer's and associations would dare to step foot. In the City, everyone has their own motives, especially someone like Roland or Angela...

                    <p>The ten patron librarians all have their own stories to share. As you progress through the main story of the game, you will unlock new episodes for each
                        of the ten floors. These episodes will help the player learn more about the patron librarian of a given floor, and get a better understanding of their feelings towards Angela.
                        Each episode comes with an abnormality battle, and players must supress the abnormality to see their stories. Most floors, excluding Binah and Hokma's floors, have four abnormality battles.
                        Other small stories between the patron librarians can be viewed as every floor is leveled up. These small stories contain the different librarians interacting with each other.

                    <h3 class="heading_style">Realizations</h3>
                    <p>After every abnormality battle is completed for a floor, and every condition is met, the floor's realization can be attempted. Realizations go in order of the library from bottom to top, starting with the
                        floor of history and ending with keter. These realizations see Angela or Roland trying to deal with different parts of the world they hate. 
                        Completing a realization helps them to accept something that has happened to them in the past, or at something they hate being a part of. Completing the realizations is crucial to getting the best ending of the game's main story, and players
                        need to complete every realization, with one exception, to do so.
