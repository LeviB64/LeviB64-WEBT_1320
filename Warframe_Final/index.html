                        Players align with the new syndicate, The Hex, to hunt down Alberecht Entrati. He holds the key to breaking out of the endless cycle of failure, and players must reach him before the Indifference can. 1999 Introduces new weapons,
                        a relationship system to the game, a new vehicle that can be used almost anywhere in the game, and much more!
