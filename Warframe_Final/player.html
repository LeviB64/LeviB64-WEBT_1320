                    <p>Warframes are the main "weapons" used by the Tenno in their missions across the universe. These warframes posses powerful abilities, armor, and regeneration
                    to combat the overwhelming numbers that make up the enemy factions. Each warframe has its own playstyle, and these playstyles range from using magentism to its fullest potential,
                    to harnessing anti-matter at will, and even to smiting enemies down with holy jade light. Warframes also play a unique role within a team, whether it be supporting the team with damage reduction 
                    or crippling your foes with things like armor-strip. With 59 different frames as of Warframe: 1999's Cyte-09, players have a plethora of options open to them for any task in the Origin System.
                    Warframes and their components must be crafted after finding their parts in missions, vendors, or quests.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>One of the many features open to the player is the ability to personalize your warframes. Once the different customizations are unlocked, players can change things like the color and helmets of
                    their equipped frames. Different pieces of armor and syndanas can be equipped to further change up how your warframe looks. Like the actual frame itself, these attachments can also be
                    colored to give them an alternate look. More recent updates have introduced ephemeras and signas, allowing players to give their frames things like an electric aura and an ornate headpiece. There
                    are thousands, if not millions of different combinations avalible to the player to make any warframe their own.

            <h3 class="heading_style">Modding</h3>
            <div class="dualcol">
                <section class="column">
                    <p>Modding your warframe is an essential part of building your warframes. Modding allows for players to improve the overall stats of their warframe by a sizable margin, and it can make the difference
                        between surviving only a few shots to besting entire armies by yourself. The two main things mods do is increase a warframes defenses, and abilities. Defensive mods increase stats such as a warframes
                        armor, which reduces damage done to your health by an increasing percentage the higher it goes. Other mods can strengthen a warframes abilities, whether it be actual strength or increasing the effective
                        range of their abilities. It is worth noting that there is a cost limit to mods, but players can use forma to match mods to their polarities. Matching a mod to its
                        polarity halves the cost of it, where as mismatching increases the cost.

                    <p>The operator, better know as the Tenno, are the actual player character controlling the warframes. They are unlocked from a quest within the game. Once unlocked, the player
                        can also personalize the Tenno to their liking, allowing for a more human character as opposed to the various themes of the warframes. Operators can follow one of five focus
                        schools, with each school having different abilities and perks. Operators also have access to a craftible amp, allowing them to weaponize their void powers against their foes.
