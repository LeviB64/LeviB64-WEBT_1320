                    <p>The Origin System, which is a futuristic version of our solar system, is the solar system most of Warframe's main game takes place. Each location has its own set of missions to take on, and is controlled
                        by one of the multiple enemy factions of the game. Moving to the different location requires the completion of different tasks, ranging from completing a story quest, to beating a certain mission in a certain way.
                        As you get further along in the system, the enemies will get stronger as well, making survival increasingly harder. Some locations, such as Lua and the Zariman, are hidden from the chart until the quests associated with them
                        are completed. <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Chart" target="_blank">Click here for more info on the Origin System.</a>

                    <p>Steel Path is a mode for players who want an even greater challenge that what the Origin System has to offer. Players must complete every mission node in the Origin System to unlock the Steel Path.
                        In the Steel Path, the level of the enemies on each planet increases by as much as a hundred levels, over three times that of your own max level. Enemy stats also recieve a massive buff on top of their levels, 
                        meaning even the weakest of enemies can be a daunting challenge to the player if they are not ready. Though the challenge is great, the Steel Path offers unique rewards that can't be found anywhere else in the system.

                    <p>Duviri is a manifestation of the void, completely seperate from the Origin System. Players will play through the different spirals of Duviri, progressing the short stories from within the tale by completing tasks like racing kaithes,
                        defeating guards, and herding tambs. Players won't be able to access their full arsenal from Duviri and will be limited to a small selection of frames and weapons they may not even own. Outside of Undercroft tasks, players will experience a
                        completely different version of combat, focusing more on melee combat involving the Drifter, the player's character while in Duviri. Each run of Duviri will consist of six main tasks,
                        and plenty of tasks to do on the side for decrees. Decrees are buffs, or drawbacks depending on the decree, that last for the run in which they are obtained. After all six main tasks are completed, players will face-off against the
                        orowyrm that corresponds to the current spiral of Duviri.
