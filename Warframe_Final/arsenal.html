                    <p>Weapons are a player's main way of dealing with their enemies. Warframe hundreds of weapons for the player to use, ranging from automatic rifles, energy bows, explosive spears, and a literal bubble gun.
                        Weapons are divided into three catagories: primary, secondary, and melee. Each catagory of weapon has their own mods that must be equipped. Weapons can be built to do extremely different things.
                        Some weapons are best used to spread status effects everywhere, some can deal massive damage to single targets, and some excel at wiping entire rooms of enemies out in seconds. Weapons, like warframes, are crafted
                        from their blueprints once they have been obtained through various means.

                    <p>Also like warframes, weapons can be personalized to the player's liking as well. The weapons all have the ability to have their color changed, and there's even an
                        option to copy the color scheme from your warframe to your weapon. Some weapons or weapon types have different skins that the player can buy to change up how they look.
                        Melee weapons can have sugurtas, which are smaller charms, added onto them. Melee weapons can also have their holster style changed, allowing the player to choose where and how
                        they store them. Warframe even allows players to hide their stowed weapons in order to show off their frames better.

            <h3 class="heading_style">Modding Your Weapons</h3>
            <div id="dualcol">
                <section class="column">
                    <p>Like warframes, modding your weapons is essential to making them shine. The main difference between modding weapons and warframes is that weapons are modded
                        to increase damage, status, and critial power. Modding for statuses allows for players to overwhelm their enemies with their weaknesses, taking them down in mere seconds if done right. 
                        The four base elements of heat, cold, electric, and toxin can be combined to create new elemental damage types. Increasing status chance mean that players will be able to inflict these status at an increased rate per shot.
                        On the other side of weapons, modding for critials can make your individual shots hit for millions of damage if done properly. Critial chance affects how often your shots crit, and power affects
                        the multiplyer a crit does. Critical chance above %100 has a chance to add a second multiplyer to the crit.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>Companions are another addition to the player's arsenal. They can range from the animals such as kubrow and kavats, to robotic sentinals like the dethcube.
                        Companions have their own weapons they can use, and while sentinals can swap them, others Companions can't. Companions, like frames and weapons, can be personalized and modded to perfection.
                        Both the actual companion and weapon are able to be modded, but only the companion can be customized visually. Compnaions have their own mods tht they use, and these mods differ from the player's own.
                        This allows for players to incorporate their pets into their loadout, causing even more chaos among their enemies.
