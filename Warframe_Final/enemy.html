                    <p>Within the entirety of Warframe, there are ten main enemy factions that will hunt you down during missions. Each of the enemy factions comes armed with their own weaponry, defenses, abilities.
                        The different factions all have their own weaknesses and resistances, meaning the same build for a weapon that's strong for one factions might be weaker against other factions.
                        Some of the factions even have subfactions within them, such as the Grineer and the Kuva Grineer, or the Corpus and Amalgam Corpus. While all these enemies are against you, they will also attack
                        each other if given the chance, allowing for Tenno to potentially side with one faction to fight against the other.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>Eximus units are stronger foes that can spawn within any of the factions. These enemies are harder to kill due to their overguard, and come equipped with special abilities that can turn the tables
                        if not taken care of quickly. These abilities range from creating a shockwave of fire, to shielding all nearby enemies, and even to leeching the health out of your warframe. Eximus enemies have a higher
                        chance to spawn as the level of the mission increases, allowing for a lot of chaotic moments if certain eximus units spawn at the same time. Every eximus type has a unique aura, allowing players to quickly single them out.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>Bosses are another form of enemy that players will encounter. These formidale foes are much stronger than their allies, and all must be foght with extreme caution.
                        Most bosses in the game have special mechanics that change up how they are fought, and they force the player to adapt to them on the fly. An example of this would be
                        Kela De Thaym, who forces you to shoot moving targets while she constantly bombards you with mortar shots from her perch. Defeating these bosses can reward the player
                        with blueprints for different warframes, so fighting them is heavily recommended.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>Assassins are foes that can spawn into most missions at a moments notice. In order to have an asssassin start their hunt, the player must provoke them or their faction.
                        The mysterious Stalker will place his mark on the player after they have defeated a boss in the Origin System. The two faction assassins, the Grustrag Three and the Zanuka Hunter,
                        will be sent after the player if they side against them in invasions too many times. Being downed by an assassin will have dire consequenses depending on the assassin, so its best to be prepared
                        at all times if marked. Syndicates can also send death squads if the player is in negative standing with them, however they aren't as dangerous as other assassins.

                <section class="column">
                    <p>Adversaries, also know as Liches, are unique enemies that exist to hunt down the player once they have been spawned in the system. They spawn with a random apperance and set of abilities based on the warframe that spawned them.
                        These Adversaries will take control of different planets that belong to their faction, and strengthen the foes on it. While an adversary is active on a planet, they will tax the player every time they complete a mission on that planet. 
                        Adversaries will appear in a mission at random if they have been angered, but only if the player is on the cooresponding planet. To defeat an adversary, players must crack the correct sequence of requiem mods. If the player is correct, the adversary
                        flees to space for the final showdown. If they are wrong, the adversary grows stronger and moves to their next planet.
